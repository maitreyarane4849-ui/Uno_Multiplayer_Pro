# Uno_Multiplayer_Pro
UNO Multiplayer Pro is a modern and interactive digital recreation of the classic UNO card game, designed to provide an engaging and competitive gameplay experience. The game allows players to enjoy UNO either multiplayer on the same PC or over a local network, bringing the traditional card game into a dynamic digital format.

#  UNO Multiplayer Pro

A browser-based **UNO card game** launched via a **single Python file**, featuring an intelligent AI bot, animations, and sound effects.
This is my **first game development project**, built to understand game logic, AI decision-making, and frontend–backend integration.

---

##  Project Overview

**UNO Multiplayer Pro** runs entirely through a Python launcher that:

* Dynamically generates the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Starts a local HTTP server
* Opens the game automatically in the browser

The game supports **single-player mode with AI bot** and **local multiplayer**.

---

##  Features

*  **Single-file Python launcher**
*  **AI Bot with Difficulty Levels**

  * Easy – random decisions
  * Medium – avoids wild misuse
  * Hard – strategic & opponent-aware
*  Clean and responsive UI
*  Hidden opponent cards
*  Card animations
*  Sound effects for actions & winning
*  Modular code for future multiplayer expansion

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Python** – Launcher & local server
* **HTML5** – Game structure
* **CSS3** – Styling, animations
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic & AI
* **HTTP Server & Sockets** – Runtime hosting

---

##  How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed

### Steps

```bash
python uno_launcher.py
```

The game will:

1. Start a local server
2. Open automatically in your default browser
3. Run completely offline
